# HomeBaseDefender
How much is your home worth to you?

##Inspiration
Houses are the biggest investment adults make. Our inspiration for this project came from the staggering cost of fixing home foundation damages. Our product will help the user with warnings before it becomes a danger.

##What it does
The HomeBase Defender takes readings of the quality of the soil that it is placed in. Customers will put the HomeBase Defender into the ground to determine the most efficient way to water their foundation.

##How we built it
We wanted to offer the user a good experience with the hardware as well as the software. So we used the particle photon microprocessor and attached it to a circuit board and placed it inside a 3D printed holder, which is then placed in the soil.

##Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few challenges when it came to making the native mobile apps for the HomeBase Defender due to the lack of knowledge and experience.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our prototype because of the 50+ person survey we performed, 77% of participants had seen symptoms of foundation damage, and only 7% of participants said they would not buy the device at a profitable markup price. Also we were able to integrate with the famous IoT hub website of IFTTT, which integrated our microprocessor to autonomous services like Text Messaging, Social Media, and even to other smart devices.

##What we learned
We learned to manage time effectively so that we will be able to plan and get a prototype done quicker without focusing to make it perfect.

##What's next for HomeBase Defender
To be able to control a valve on a soaker hose autonomously as well as a water induction valve. We also need native apps for smartphones.

##Built With
particle-photon, javascript, html, css, ifttt
